   Python Program for Clique Decision Problem and Independent Set Problem
#  Clique Decision Problem:
    A complete subgraph of a graph G=(V,E) is a clique.
    In this program(clique.py) we first take a matrix as the input, and ask the number of vertices.
    Here we have taken the matrix as:
    matrix=[[0,1,1,0],
            [1,0,1,1],
            [1,1,0,1],
            [0,1,1,0]]
    So the graph would have 4 vertices namely (0,1,2,3).
    The matrix with the size of the clique is passed to clique function.
    In clique function:
       In this function first we take the vertices for which we have to check if a clique exists or not.
       After this we check if there is no edge between 2 given vertices and also if they both belong to the clique set.
       If this condition satifies then failure occurs else success.
# Independent Set Problem
